Header Files
	Every .cc file should have an associated .h file
		Exceptions include unittests and small .cc files w/ only main() function
		
	Self-contained Headers
		Compile on their own, end in .h
		Should contain header guards and include all necessary headers
		Prefer placing definitions for template and inline functions in the same file as their declarations which are included into every .cc files that uses them

	The #define Guard
		To prevent multiple inclusion
		Format <PROJECT>_<PATH>_<FILE>_H_
			Based on full path in project source tree
