/*
4.3 List of Depths: Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes
at each depth (e.g., if you have a tree with depth 0, you'll have 0 linked lists).

#pragma region Hints
/*
Hints: 
#107. Try modifying a graph search algorithm to track the depth from the root. 

#123. A hash table or array that maps from level number to nodes at that level might also be
useful.

#135. You should be able to come up with an algorithm involving both depth-first search and
breadth-first search.
