/*
7.2 Call Center: Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: respondent, manager,
and director. An incoming telephone call must be first allocated to a respondent who is free. If the
respondent can't handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to a manager. If the manager is not
free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to a director. Design the classes and
data structures for this problem. Implement a method dispatchCall() which assigns a call to
the first available employee.
