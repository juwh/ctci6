/*
3.6 Animal Shelter: An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a
strictly "first in, first out" basis. People must adopt either the "oldest" (based on
arrival time) of all animal at the shelter, or they can select whether they would prefer
a dog or cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type). They cannot sleect which
specific animal they would like. Create the data structures to maintain this system and
implement operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog, and dequeueCat. You may
use the built-in LinkedList data structure.

/*
Hints:
#22. We could consider keeping a singly linked list for dogs and cats, and then
iterating through it to find the first dog (or cat). What is the impact of doing this?

#56. Let's suppose we kept separate lists for dogs and cats. How would we find the
oldest animal of any type> Be creative!

#63. Think about how you'd do it in real life. You have a list of dogs in chronological
order and a list of cats in chronological order. What data would you need to find the
oldest animal? How would you maintain this data?
