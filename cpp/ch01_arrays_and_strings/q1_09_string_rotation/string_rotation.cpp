/*
1.9 String Rotation: Assume you have a method IsSubstring which checks if one word is a
substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a
rotation of s1 using only one call to IsSubstring (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of
"erbottlewat").

Hints: #34, #88, #104
